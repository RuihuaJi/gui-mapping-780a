## Dataset Anonymization During Review

The mapped widgets in our dataset are collected by the authors from the real-world apps, including the screenshots and XML layout files displaying the mapped widgets. 

Some of these apps require user login, and personal information is displayed when running the apps. 
These personal information will be captured by the screenshots and XML layout files, and it may violate the double-anonymity policy.
To comply with this policy, the authors removed the screenshots and XML layout files containing their names and email addresses. 

The resulting dataset contains approximately 80% of the original mapped widgets (**5258** mapped widgets and **959** screen pairs) at the current stage of the double-anonymous review process.
The authors plan to update the open repository with the entire dataset once the double-anonymous review process is complete.
